## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This project is an opportunity to practice my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS.

I was able to use CSS variables (:root) and I was also able to use a tool to minify and compress the CSS, thus decreasing the site's loading time

### Continued development

I plan to add JavaScript in the future so that the site displays information dynamically.

I will continue studying and improving my CSS so that in the future I can add animations to make the site more dynamic

### Useful resources

- [Grid](https://www.origamid.com/projetos/css-grid-layout-guia-completo/) - This article helped me better understand how the display grid works and how its properties work.
